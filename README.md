# standard-glider-files

[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/us-amlr/standard-glider-files)](https://github.com/us-amlr/standard-glider-files/commits/main)

A repository for standard files that are put on all US AMLR Slocum gliders before deployment. These files can then be edited for the specific mission and specific glider payload. 

Note that this repo has a [gh action](.github/workflows/decompress_ccc.yml) that automatically decompresses new compressed cache (i.e., *.ccc) files, and commits decompressed (i.e., *.cac) file to the repo.

View the [wiki](https://github.com/us-amlr/Standard-glider-files/wiki) for full documentation and examples, or the [ESD glider lab manual](https://swfsc.github.io/glider-lab-manual/) for broader ESD glider lab context.
